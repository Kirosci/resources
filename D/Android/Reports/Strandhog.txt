## Security Vulnerability Report: StrandHogg Bug in Backblaze Android App

### Description:
I would like to report a critical security vulnerability, known as the StrandHogg bug, in the Backblaze Android app. This vulnerability allows a malicious application to pose as the legitimate Backblaze app and perform various unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. The bug leverages a flaw in Android's multitasking system, enabling attackers to hijack the user's session and potentially gain access to sensitive information.

### Proof of Concept (PoC):
1. Install a malicious app (attacker-controlled) on the same device as the Backblaze app. (Attached exploit APK)
2. Launch the malicious app, then open the original Backblaze app. Clicking the back button triggers the StrandHogg vulnerability, as shown in the PoC video.
   - When the user taps back on the original Backblaze app, a fake page appears.
3. The malicious app will appear as a legitimate Backblaze app on the device screen.
4. When the user interacts with the fake Backblaze app, the attacker can perform malicious actions, such as capturing login credentials, reading sensitive data, sending fraudulent messages, or initiating unauthorized transactions.
   - PoC video is attached for better understanding.

### Impact:
The impact of this vulnerability can be severe, compromising the privacy and security of Backblaze users. The following are potential risks and consequences:

- *Credential Theft:* Attackers can capture login credentials (username and password) entered by users and use them to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- *Sensitive Data Exposure:* Personal information, including contact lists, messages, and sensitive business data, may be accessed and exploited by attackers.
- *Financial Loss:* Attackers can initiate fraudulent transactions or access sensitive financial information, leading to financial loss for the user or the organization.
- *Unauthorized Actions:* Attackers can manipulate the app's functionalities to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as sending misleading messages, accessing location data, or making unwanted calls.

### Remediation:
To address this vulnerability in the Backblaze app, the following steps can be taken:

1. Set the `launchMode` to `singleInstance`, which will prevent other activities from becoming a part of its task.
2. Add a custom `onBackPressed()` function to override the default behavior.
3. Setting `taskAffinity=""` can be a quick fix for this issue.

Please let me know if you require any further information or assistance regarding this vulnerability.
