1. Check request and reponse for valid otp
2. Check request and reponse for wrong otp
3. Response manipulation: Status code , Paramter value


1. Enabled 2fa 
2. Check syntax  JSON {"any":"value"}
3. Valid OTP response
4. Wrong OTP response : 400 -> 200 OK
5. {"success":true}
6. Forward request = Bypassed 2fa


HTML :
1. We checked parameter based

true = false
NotVerfied = verfied 
falseVerfied =
failure = success
error = OK , success , valid

2. Ask otp on attackers number 
3. Verfied OTP = Check response = attacker number 
4. Check response = attacker number - > victim phone number
5. OTP bypassed

1. How it is working



1st account: aditya@hackersera.com = Valid OTP = Validated = 200 OK = Token 
2nd account: security@flock.com = Wrong OTP = Validated = 400 Bad request -> 200 OK = Token

Hi team,


Aditya here found insecure function exploitation on app.october.eu

Bug: Business logic vulnerability in invite function leads to victim response fetching via email of october.eu

While testing I found behavior in invite
function that sends hook mail to 
which we put in email section. Whenever we
get email it shows NAME and some data. I used
Burp_Collaborator_Link.net" So I got mail which
was showing link
Burp_Collaborator_Link.net and the link is in
blue part so once who click on It will fetch
response of that person or victim. Main point is
Ifl registers the form with email of victim and
hit send it ill send mail on victim email
address via october address 

How it will impact victim ?

Hacker will use email id of victim for invite
process. In every section hacker will use
collaborator link or grabbing link and registered
with victim email address. Victim will receive
mail with link once user interacted with link hacker will
get response in POLL


Business impact:


Normal user will think he got mail from october.eu but as we know function dont have security to verify invite . So it will harm multiple users on behalf on october.eu 

Bug verified by other company also.


I hope you will patch it soon



Hi team,

While more testing I found that I can force a user to download any file hacker want on behalf of october.eu and also hacker can craft login page to obtain or hack a user on behalf of october.eu.

RFD(Reflected File Download):

Hacker can set any malicious file which contain virus on his server. While invite he can invite user as bug I mentioned initially by just adding his site as https://hacker.com/page/download?file=anything.bat

Once user click on it will download and execute on victim machine so victim will thin that october.eu mail infected me


Login to obtain credentials:
Hacker can set login.html file on his server which will save creds of victim. Hacker will use same scenario as I mentioned in RFD
